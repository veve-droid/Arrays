# Arrays
Title: Let me search it and reverse it


Prompt the user with the following menu:

Reverse

Palindromic

Search

Count n-digit numbers

Exit

For item 1, ask the user to enter 10 integers. Then display them in reverse order. Sample: 1 3 2 5 4 9 7 8 6 10 Output: 10 6 8 7 9 4 5 2 3 1

For item 2, ask the user to enter 10 1- digit integers. Determine if the collection of numbers forms a palindrome or not. Sample: 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 Output: Palindromic

For item 3, ask the user to enter 10 sorted integers (increasing). The program should not allow the user to enter 10 numbers that are sorted. They must be asked to re-enter inputs. Ask for an 11th integer, say x. Search for x in the array. Note: Take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted.

For item 4, Ask the user to enter 20 non-negative integers. You are to store this in an array. The task is to count frequencies. How many elements are 1-digit numbers, how many are 2-digits numbers, 3-digit, 4-digit, 5-digit, 6-digit, 7-digit, 8-digit, 9-digit, and 10-digit numbers.

The frequencies must be stored in a separate array.  Once the frequencies are computed, determine which n-digit numbers appear the most, and which appear the least (least non-zero count).


For item 5, terminates the program.
